                        <p><strong>1st Wave of Coffee</strong>
                           The first wave of Coffee dates back to the 1800s when this beverage consumption started to grow exponentially, brands such as Folgers and Maxwell House are an example of the forerunners of this wave.
                            Quality was not important as price in this wave.  A great innovation in this wave was the Vacuum packing which took the air out of the coffee tins to maintain the freshness of the beans. 
                            There was zero knowledge about the origins of the coffee or processes. The focal point of this wave was to make coffee a widely consumed product, to become a mass market product which could be found in every household. 
                            An innovation which marked this first wave was the invention of instant or soluble coffee which made the preparation of coffee a fast and convenient way to make this beverage.</p>

                        <p><strong>2nd Wave of Coffee</strong>
                           The second wave of Coffee started in the 1970s especially with the birth of the now coffee giant Starbucks which understood that people needed to see coffee as a whole experience rather than just as a beverage. 
                           Customers started expressing the desire to know more about the origins of their coffees and the unique roasting styles, thus bringing the start of the specialty coffee era.
                           The most important characteristic of this wave, is that the coffee experience evolved from just a quick caffeine fix to a point of encounter, thus making coffee shops a point where people went to have social interactions and giving coffee a special place in the social dynamic.
                        </p><br>
                        <p><strong>3rd Wave of Coffee</strong>
                           The third wave of Coffee as a term was first used by Trish Rothgeb back in 2002 published in the Roasters Guild Publication defining the three Coffee movements as “waves”. 
                           This wave is characterized by a market made up of much more sophisticated coffee consumers, that are interested in having an exceptional cup of coffee rather than just a cup of who-knows-where this came coffee from?
                           An important feature of this wave is that of the Specialty Coffee which was a turning point on the coffee industry. 
                           The quality of the coffee became very important, and with it, a lot of other aspects of the coffee such as the formation and professionality of the barista, the traceability of the coffee beans, micro roasters and fair-trade coffee just to mention a few.

                              Coffea Arabica or just Arabica is also known as the Arabian Coffee. This is one of the two main species of Coffee, it
                              is regarded as the one with a rich and complex organoleptic profile and better quality, no wonder why it represents
                              approximately the 60% of the worlds coffee production. Arabica is grown all over the world, in regions such as
                              Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. It is thought to be the first type of Coffee to be cultivated in the
                              world.</p><br>

                           <p><strong>Bean</strong> <br>
                              The seed of the coffee cherry is better known as &ldquo;The Bean&rdquo; which is later roasted and ground to make
                              that delicious beverage we all love, especially in the mornings.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Bitter</strong><br>
                              Bitterness on coffee is a characteristic of the flavor which is harsh and not sweet, for example; Dark Roasts are
                              made intentionally to give a bitter taste.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Body</strong><br>
                              The body of the coffee is intended to explain the texture of the beverage, it ranges from thin, delicate, juicy,
                              syrupy and heavy.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Bloom</strong><br>
                              The process of pouring a small amount of water to the coffee grounds to prepare the process of extraction saturating
                              and degassing the grounds.Normally freshly roasted coffee contains CO2 and other kinds of gases for about three weeks,
                              the blooming process is intended for liberating these gases and thus achieving an optimal aroma and flavor.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Brewing Ratio</strong><br>
                              It is expressed as the ratio of ground coffee mass to water mass used during extraction. It can be expressed with the
                              European standard which is g/l(grams per liter/ e.g. 60g/l for pour-over coffee) or with the American standard
                              1:x(e.g. 1:16 it&rsquo;s the same as 60g/l)</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Brewing temperature</strong><br>
                              One of the most important parameters during the extraction phase is the water temperature. It substantially affects
                              the organoleptic characteristics of the coffee cup. Usually, temperatures between 92 &deg; C and 98 &deg; C are
                              preferred: low temperatures emphasize the acidity and the fruity scents, while higher temperatures mostly extract the
                              chocolatey and toasted notes up to the bitter. It is possible to precisely control the water temperature by using
                              electric boilers with temperature setting or special thermometers for traditional boilers.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Brewing time</strong><br>
                              It refers to the period of time in which the water comes in contact with the ground coffee, this is when the
                              extraction happens.There is an optimal brewing time for every method, check out our brewing guides for more details.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Bright</strong><br>
                              The acidity flavor in coffee is described as bright, it is very common in Central American Coffees such as Guatemala,
                              Colombia, Costa Rica, Kenia, and Ethiopia. This acidity or bright can be tasted at the tip of your tongue.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Briny</strong> <br>
                              Briny is a salty flavor caused by the excessive exposure of Coffee to heat.</p><br>

                           <p><strong>Caffeine</strong><br>
                              Main natural alkaloid present in coffee, responsible for the stimulating and psychoactive effect of this drink. From
                              a sensorial point of view, it gives bitter notes to coffee, which is why the Robusta, which contains more caffeine
                              than Arabica, is characterized by a more marked bitterness. The amount of caffeine contained in the coffee beans
                              varies according to the cultivar, however, the content of this alkaloid extracted in the drink depends substantially
                              on the extraction method and on the contact time between coffee and water.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Cappuccino</strong><br>

                              The tradition says that there should be a big patch of milk foam surrounded by a thin brown circle.
                              The Latte Art technique foresees the decoration of the cappuccino with diverse designs obtained thanks to a particular mastery when
                              pouring the foamed milk.</p><br>

                              The berry borer is a beetle-like insect native to Africa which is causing a lot of problems to coffee farmers all
                              over the world because it infests the cherries ruining the beans.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Coffee leaf rust &ndash; Coffee rust, or &ldquo;la roya&rdquo;</strong><br>
                              The Coffee Leaf Rust is a fungus that is affecting the coffee plantations in Central and South America,
                              causing the plant to lose its leaves thus rendering the plant unable to produce fruits.</p><br>
                           
                           <p><strong>Cold Brew Coffee</strong><br>
                              Cold brew is basically a type of coffee that instead of being brewed with hot water it is done with cold water at a
                              very slow rate, this method can be drip or immersion. Cold brewed coffee is much less acidic and it is characterized
                              by a particular flavor development. The cold infusion method exalts all the characteristics in the coffee, both
                              positive and negative. this is why it is fundamental to use a high-quality coffee to make sure that the resulting cup
                              is a great one.</p><br>

                              Cold Drip is an extraction method which consists of leaving cold water dripping over the grounds of the coffee at a
                              slow rate for many hours, resulting in a brew with many different characteristics as those of hot water coffee
                              extraction methods.</p><br>

                              Cup of excellence or (COE) A contest to decide which is the best coffee grown in a particular country. The COE uses
                              the Specialty Coffee Association protocol to grade the coffee. Only coffees with a grade of 90/100 or higher can
                              obtain this qualification. (Approximately 10% of specialty coffee)</p><br>

                              Also known as &ldquo;World&rsquo;s most expensive Coffee&rdquo; is a type of Coffee made with the help of a little
                              cat-like animal named Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus Hermaphroditus) native to southeast Asia. Coffee cherries are
                              eaten and then excreting the partially digested beans, and theoretically, it makes the flavor of the coffee even
                              better. Given the difficulty of finding the civet droppings in the wild, and having to collect them by hand the price
                              is inflated so much that it has been renamed as the most expensive coffee. The problem with this coffee is that
                              because of its high demand, some farmers started caging the animals and feeding them only coffee cherries thus
                              restricting their diet and making them suffer in the process, that&rsquo;s why many activists have called out
                              companies that sell that coffee and asking the public to not consume this product.</p><br>

                              the coffee beans tend to lose most of their humidity they then start getting brownish and depending on the roasting
                              time the darker they will get. This process is vital to the development of the flavors that will then be extracted on

                              having a smaller and rounder bean. Its organoleptic profile is less rich and complex compared to that of the Arabica.
                              Usually, it is used in mixes intended for espresso because it gives a strong bitter note and a more consistent crema.
                              It has a higher index of caffeine than arabica and because of this motive, it is usually not used for the filter
                              coffee. From a botanical point of view, the Robusta plant is more studier and more productive than its similar
                              Arabica.</p><br>

                              Coffee is an agricultural product with its own seasonality, that varies depending on the producing countries. A

                              normally a higher quality it means that these beans will not be available all year long. Seasonal coffee is different
                              from commercial coffee because commercial coffee has such great volumes that it can be available all year long.</p><br>

                           <p>This style of processing the coffee which is a mix of the dry processing and the washed
                              these terms often refer to the same style of processing, where the first stages of the above are followed up until
                              the cherries are pulped. Then, instead of fermenting the coffee in tanks, it is sent to be dried while the mucilage
                              is still intact and stuck to the seeds. As the seeds dry, the mucilage loses a good deal of moisture but can
                              contribute a greater degree of sweetness to the seeds (perhaps because less fermentation is taking place, meaning
                              fewer sugars are being consumed by microorganisms). Once dried, the seeds may be washed to remove the stuck on pulp,
                              or simply proceed to de-hulling. The green coffee seeds may also be dried again to reach the desired moisture
                              content, as drying coffee in this state can take longer than the washed process. This process can also introduce
                              complications that lead to flavor degradation, including mold growth, rot, and pests which are attracted to the
                              sweet-tasting mucilage as it dries in the open air. These coffees must be carefully attended to during drying to
                              properly maintain their flavor.</p><br>
